# Summary of project: 
In this project, we will take the role of a data scientist working for the new rocket company SpaceY. More in details, we will predict if the «Falcon 9» first stage will land successfully and consequently the price of each launch. In fact SpaceX advertises «Falcon 9» rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars, while other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars. This big difference is due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage if it lands successfully.

# Summary of methodologies: 
To accomplish this we will gather data about SpaceX and create some visualization and dashboards for our team. Data will be gathered in 2 ways: with the SpaceX REST API call and with Web Scraping of some Wiki Tables.

# Summary of all results: 
The insights we found with this analysis is that the different launch sites have different success rates, and different maximum payload masses they carry; there are 4 main orbits that have a very high success rate (0.9-1.0), while all the others are around 0.6; only some orbtits’ success rate is linked to the Flight number; the success rate has kept increasing from 2013 to 2020. Furthermore, the application of the machine learning classification models, showed that the best model to predict if the first stage will land successfully is the decision tree classification model.

Project questions:
* Will the first stage land successfully or not?
* What will then be the price of a launch?
